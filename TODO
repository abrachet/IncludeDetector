Lexer TODO:
    create a vector for currently known types
        typedef and class/enum/struct will add to these types
    parse includes to know when to export symbols versus add types to type vector

    create a lexer for source files which searches for all symbols that aren't known symbols
        for source files, parse the include files to know whcih files are 

    update all functions which call export to call the new export, not the old one

    rework on typedef function, template and namespace (and also using)

Symtable:
    add a mutex for writes to the sym table (no need for reads)

    sym_file.c's get_sym_file_path is currently just returning "symfile"
        need to make find a suitable location for the file, as well as refinding where it put it


Argument Handling:
    needs a lot of revamping...
